# layered-qimage
a proof of concept for representing (or compositing) multiple layers into a single image in the Qt framework

> hitting the "Combine" button composites the two images (shown on top of each other in the Layered View) into a single image -- this demonstrates the final render of a single QImage from a 2-layer set of images.

> there is some commented code that will optionally write a .png of the final image to the build folder
